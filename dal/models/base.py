"""SQLAlchemy declarative base and shared column types.

Authored sub-objects (the hint rungs, the analogy card) are stored as JSON rather than
normalised into their own tables. They are opaque content blobs: always read and written
whole with their step, never queried by their inner fields. Normalising them would buy
four joins and no query power.
